# JavaReader
JavaReader includes external classes that function as input parsing alternatives to the Java's standard *Scanner* and *JOptionPane*.

## How to Use
Clone the repository to your project's directory, and simply call methods from `Shell` or `Win`, depending on whether you want to parse input from the console or from a pop-up window. Here's a list of some supported parsing methods:

* `readInt`
* `readDouble`
* `readString`
